# Real-Time Retail Data Pipeline

A real-time retail data engineering project built with Python, Kafka, Spark, and layered data architecture principles.

This project simulates a retail company's streaming order pipeline using intentionally messy and imperfect data to practice real-world data engineering scenarios including:

* Streaming ingestion with Kafka
* Producer/Consumer workflows
* Bronze/Silver/Gold architecture
* Dirty data handling
* Data cleaning and transformation
* Schema standardization
* Data quality validation

The pipeline generates realistic retail activity including customers, products, suppliers, employees, and streaming orders with simulated inconsistencies such as:

* Missing values
* Invalid foreign keys
* Duplicate records
* Incorrect date formats
* Future timestamps
* Negative quantities
* Corrupted business records

The goal of the project is to build hands-on experience with modern data engineering workflows and realistic ETL challenges.

Powered by caffeine, Kafka, and vampire working hours.




## Architecture

The project follows a layered data architecture approach:

* **Bronze Layer** → Raw ingested streaming and generated data
* **Silver Layer** → Cleaned and standardized datasets
* **Gold Layer** → Final analytical datasets and reporting-ready outputs

This structure simulates real-world ETL and modern data engineering workflows.

The Customer Silver Layer standardizes and validates customer records before they are passed to downstream analytical layers.

Implemented checks include:

* Standardized customer first names
* Standardized customer last names
* Handled missing country values
* Calculated customer age from birthdate
* Validated customer age against business rules (16–100 years old)
* Identified future birthdates
* Quarantined invalid customer records for investigation
* Separated valid and rejected customer datasets

## Product Silver Layer Features

The Product Silver Layer standardizes and validates product records before they are passed to downstream analytical layers.

Implemented checks include:

* Standardized product names
* Standardized product categories
* Preserved original brand values
* Identified products with missing unit prices
* Identified products with negative stock quantities
* Validated supplier references against the supplier dataset
* Quarantined invalid product records for investigation
* Separated valid and rejected product datasets

## Supplier Silver Layer Features

The Supplier Silver Layer performs data quality validation on supplier records before they are used by downstream analytical processes.

Implemented checks include:

* Missing supplier ID validation
* Supplier ID uniqueness validation
* Missing supplier name validation
* Missing email validation
* Lead time validation
* Reliability score validation (0-100 range)
* Supplier quality audit reporting

## Employee Silver Layer Features

The Employee Silver Layer standardizes and validates employee records before they are used by downstream analytical processes.

Implemented checks include:

* Standardized department names
* Preserved IT department abbreviation
* Standardized country values
* Converted manager IDs to the correct integer data type
* Validated manager references against existing employee records
* Allowed null manager IDs for top-level management positions
* Performed employee-manager integrity validation

## Pipeline Flow

1. Generate retail datasets (customers, employees, suppliers, products)
2. Stream order events through Kafka producer
3. Consume streaming events into Bronze layer storage
4. Simulate dirty and inconsistent real-world data
5. Clean and standardize records in the Silver layer
6. Prepare future analytical datasets in the Gold layer

## Dirty Data Simulation

The project intentionally generates problematic records to simulate realistic business data challenges, including:

* Missing values
* Invalid customer IDs
* Duplicate order IDs
* Future dates
* Incorrect date formats
* Negative quantities
* Inconsistent text formatting
* Corrupted business logic

## Future Enhancements

* Azure Blob Storage / Azure Data Lake integration
* Databricks implementation with Delta Lake
* Lakehouse architecture using the Medallion (Bronze, Silver, Gold) approach
* Star and Snowflake schema modeling
* Automated data quality monitoring and validation reporting
* Pipeline health and execution monitoring
* Business alerting and anomaly detection
* Power BI executive dashboards

## Planned Monitoring Features

* Automated alerts when sales drop below historical averages
* Notifications for unusual spikes or declines in product demand
* Pipeline status monitoring for ingestion and transformation jobs
* Data quality reports highlighting failed validation checks
* Dashboard refresh and data pipeline execution tracking
* Exception reporting for missing, invalid, or inconsistent records
